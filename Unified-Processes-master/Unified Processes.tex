\subsection{Goal- To Enable Project Manager to Develop Project Time Management Plan}
\subsection{Actors - Project Manager, Team Members}
\subsection{Scenario}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Provide GUI for Project Manager to Define Activities by identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce the project deliverables.
  \item Provide GUI for Project Manager to Sequence Activities by identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities.
  \item Provide GUI for Project Manager to Estimate Activity Resources by estimating the type and quantities of material, human resources, equipment, or supplies required to perform each activity.
  \item Provide GUI for Project Manager to Estimate Activity Durations by estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual activities with estimated resources.
  \item Provide GUI for Project Manager to Develop Schedule by analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule constraints to create the project schedule model.
  \item download the document as a pdf by selecting Export $>$ Local
        Filesystem (or by clicking the desktop download button)
  \item Provide GUI for Project Manager to Control Schedule by monitoring the status of project activities to update project progress and manage changes to the schedule baseline to achieve the plan.
